# NuGuild Chat

The goal of this project is to provide a simple yet effect approach to text and voice chat. Rather than catgorizing channels into guilds, the structure is inverted using tags. Each channel is created and adminstrated by one user. Channel categories do exist, but only for the sake of mass tagging and created mass invites to private channels.
